###### The Sailbuoy

From Offfshore Sensing:
>Field-proven to stay for months at sea, it navigates the oceans autonomously - transmitting back data at regular intervals. The Sailbuoy can be used for a wide variety of ocean applications. From measuring ocean and atmospheric parameters to tracking oil spills or acting as a communication relay station for subsea instrumentation. You can follow the Sailbuoy and update tracks in real-time from your computer, tablet or smart phone.
